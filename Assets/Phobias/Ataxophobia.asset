  description: Fear of a mess
  developed: Ancient walls collapsed all around me. There is no order to it! Nothing
    but chaos in these wastes!
  attackAnxiety:
  - 'The chambers are worse as I descend. Surrounded by this disarray! '
  - The chaos of these shattered rooms steals the breath from my lungs!
  - Sure, it would be better if I could just clean it up, but I'd have to go near
    each of these atrocious piles of debris!
