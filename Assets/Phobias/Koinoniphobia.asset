  description: Fear of rooms
  developed: Endless chambers. Their echoes are whispers of a mad deity, calling
    me to its side.
  attackAnxiety:
  - There are so many. Too many rooms buried in the darkness!
  - Maybe the next exit will offer respite from the embrace of these abandoned halls.
  - 'Delving into a ruined and forgotten city full of ancient rooms... It''s too
    much, they wrap their horrid walls around me! '
