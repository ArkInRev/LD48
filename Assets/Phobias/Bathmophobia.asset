  description: Fear of slopes and stairs
  developed: Descending; ever descending. These passages down will be my ruin.
  attackAnxiety:
  - Another descent. Another abominable passage that rends my sanity.
  - Why is there no other way to traverse these layers? How can I go on?
  - Who builds something like this? Just, pick a level and stop it with all of these
    descents.
