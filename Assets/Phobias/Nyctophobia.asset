  description: Fear of the dark
  developed: The time in the dark, smothered by endless shadow, I can no longer endure
    the darkness.
  attackAnxiety:
  - 'No respite beneath the earth. Everything is darkness and it surrounds me. '
  - Shadows lurking everywhere. Nowhere is safe! Nowhere!
  - 'Things couldn''t be worse: A fear of the dark, and ancient relics buried in
    forgotten depths. '
