  description: Fear of books
  developed: The words leap from the pages. Their maddening cacophony is too much.
    I must avoid them!
  attackAnxiety:
  - 'They whisper their torments in the language of the deep. '
  - 'These pages sink barbed hooks into my mind. '
  - I can endure. These fiendish tomes need to be destroyed. Maybe someone else could
    do it?
