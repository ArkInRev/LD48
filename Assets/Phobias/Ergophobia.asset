  description: Fear of work
  developed: You suddenly find manual labor very frightening.
  attackAnxiety:
  - This is too much work. I can't keep at this!
  - At least I can use magic to remove this. The thought of doing this... no... no.
    Just close your eyes and use the magic.
  - 'It''s not that much, really. Deep breath. I can do this. '
